Taylors Collision in Duluth is a top-notch shop! My Model S recently suffered significant hood damage, and Max at Taylors did an outstanding job repairing it. The paint match is flawless—there isn’t even a hint that any damage was ever there.\n\nI’m very detail-oriented, and finding a shop I can fully trust has always felt nearly impossible. I’ve heard plenty of horror stories, but after this experience, Taylors Collision is now my go-to for high-end, quality work.\n\nI also have to mention Max—he’s a man of integrity, honesty, and professionalism. It’s rare to come across someone so trustworthy in this industry. I couldn’t recommend him and the shop more highly.', 1727049600),

My 15 year old Accord looks virtually brand new now with the new bumper and headlights.\n\nThe paint work is professional - no orange peel here. What impressed me the most, however, is that they were more than happy to buff out a couple scratches that they had accidentally put on the car during repairs. I pointed them out to Max when I came to pick up the car, and he immediately directed his team to come over and buff the blemishes right there on the spot.\n\nMax was very professional and friendly, and his team did beautiful work on my car. Shop local, and give these guys a try!', 1724457600),

Max promptly assessed the damage and provided a quote within minutes, which was more competitive than the three other estimates we received.\n\nWe left the vehicle with an expected completion time of four days. Although the shop was clearly busy, the team remained highly responsive throughout the process and made the experience significantly less stressful. The repairs were completed on schedule, and the car looked like new when we picked it up.\n\nMy wife and I highly recommend Taylor’s Collision for their professionalism, communication, and quality of work.', 1737417600),

If I had to describe them in a few words, it would be men of character, honesty, and transparency.\n\nA few years ago, we purchased a bus for our ministry. When Max saw it, he immediately volunteered to help us prepare it before taking it to Nicaragua. Out of pure generosity, they repainted the hood, repaired the AC, and completed several other repairs—not for profit, but simply because they care. That act alone spoke volumes about their hearts, and I could share many more stories like it.\n\nIn a world where genuine kindness is rare, their goodness has brought me to tears on more than one occasion. Taylor’s Collision isn’t just about quality work—it’s about people who serve with integrity and heart. I couldn’t recommend them more highly.', 1721865600),

Highly recommend anyone who needs their car to look good as new.', 1727049600),
